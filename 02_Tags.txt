Tags in Ansible
- We have a playbook with multiple tasks and on running this playbook all the tasks will run but if we want to perform only few tasks then creating a new playbook for it is not a good approach so for that we use tags.
- We can associate tags with each task.


---
- name: installing and starting a package
  hosts: localhost
  become: true  #tasks should be run with sudo privileges 

  tasks:

  - name: installing nginx
    yum: #module 
      name: nginx # name of the package
      state: present
    tags: i-nginx

  - name: starting the nginx service
    service: 
      name: nginx
      state: started
      enabled: true 
    tags: ss-nginx

1) Command to list the tags in a playbook
ansible-playbook <playbook-name> --list-tags

2) Command to run a specific task
ansible-playbook <playbook-name> -t i-nginx

3) Command to stop a specific task from running
ansible-playbook <playbook-name> --skip-tags ss-nginx
