Advantages of using Ansible

· Simple and easy to use: Ansible uses a simple and easy-to-learn language
(YAML) to define playbooks, which makes it easy for anyone to use, even
those with little or no programming experience.

· Agentless architecture: Ansible does not require any agents to be installed
on remote systems, which makes it easy to set up and use.

· Configuration management: Ansible can be used to automate configuration
management tasks such as provisioning, application deployment, and
infrastructure management.

· Scalability: Ansible can manage a large number of systems simultaneously,
making it ideal for large-scale deployments.

· Ansible playbooks can be run multiple times without changing the system state.

. Open-source: Ansible is an open-source tool, which means it is free to use and
has a large community of contributors who regularly contribute to its
development.

· Integration with other tools: Ansible can be integrated with other tools such as
Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS, which makes it versatile and easy to use in a
variety of environments.
